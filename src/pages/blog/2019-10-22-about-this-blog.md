## Gatsby, React, Netlify, ...

I tried a few static website generator like hugo, jekyll. And It turns out I have to use Gatsby since it's React friendly so makes it more extensible.

I feel like I have to learn React because most of the frontend job description comes with it and I generally like  its way



 to encapsulate code and view together and pass messages around the components. It just feels more like OOP and maybe makes it more manageable while the code base's growing.

Gatsby also comes with graphQL as an abstraction layer to support many different kind of data source to build the static website. For example, headless wordpress CMS, markdown files in your repo, restful api from your original site.

Although I'm still not familiar with this tool, the speed of opening up static web site makes m

e believe it's the future of I would like to be with.

## Netlify

updating static website was a bit tedious.

* modify, run local dev server check if it's ok.
* commit the changes to git, and deploy to your hosting server.(I tried github pages, but it still requires a hook to your commit to build the site, and push to the page repo.

netlify is the tool to save us from the hassles.

* 1st it comes with cms library to allow you/your customer to modify the site easily without writing code.
* it also monitors your git repo, build the site automatically once triggered by your push.
* domain name service if you need
* deploy sites on different branches automatically

It saves many problems with static website generators, what a great SAAS startup!

I would like to help on i18n and mobile editor experience on netlify cms interface if I could.

## TODOS:

I will continue improving this site, here is a list of what i'm doing

1. PWA
2. incorporate my projects/tools into this site

* Map
* dictionary
* 3D d0g
* wasm, x86-64, arm assembly visualization with d3?
