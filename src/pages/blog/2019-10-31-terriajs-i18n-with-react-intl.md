I'm working on a Taiwan Web GIS system to display some data i'm interested and as a frontend for some future backend services developed in rails.
我在做一個台灣網頁地圖資訊系統，希望可以把我有希望的資料做簡單視覺化，以及日後用 rails 開發一些互動功能，讓我可以。

https://map.owlfox.org


currently it supports:
1. AQI air quality index.
2. a simple 3D city tile set of Taichung.

It's based on a Aussie project, [terriaJSI](https://terria.io) I'm also studying how to do i18n efficiently with React, hopefully I will make this site easy for both English and Taiwanese mandarin users.
