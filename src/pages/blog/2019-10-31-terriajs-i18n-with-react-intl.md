I'm working on a Taiwan Web GIS system to display some data i'm interested and as a frontend for some future backend services developed in rails.


https://map.owlfox.org


currently it serves:
1. AQI air quality index.
2. a simple 3D city tile set of Taichung.

It's based on an Aussie project, [terriaJSI](https://terria.io).
I'm also studying how to do i18n efficiently with React, hopefully I will make this site easy for both English and Taiwanese mandarin users.
