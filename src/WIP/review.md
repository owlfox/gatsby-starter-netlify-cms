As usual, this year is nothing but another year to me. I remember that I spent my last moment of 2018 in Bordertown of Australia. It was perfectly quiet and lonely but I still felt okay since I think I'm kinda a grownup for being able to live abroad plus practice my English.
I was planning to stay in Australia for a long time, get a PR maybe and just probably just leave Taiwan as somewhere I came from. Then things happened, my family dog went to heaven, my grandma was getting weaker day by day and I felt like WEAK. So I retreated back to Taiwan and try to restart my professional life here. A total failure, isn't it?
Yes, I know that, the same feeling happens every year since 2006. I made a lot of choices and it looks awful when they come together. But we still have to believe everything will be fine. I can fix it one day. I know I am being treated like shit by others and I will fix it.
